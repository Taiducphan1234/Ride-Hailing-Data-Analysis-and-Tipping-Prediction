# Ride-Hailing-Data-Analysis-and-Tipping-Prediction

This project analyzes ride-hailing data to understand tipping practices and develop a model to predict tip likelihood.

## Data: The project utilizes a ride-hailing dataset containing information about ride trips. This data might include details like:
- Trip distance
- Duration
- Pickup and drop-off locations
- Trip fare
- Whether a tip was received


## Analysis:
The analysis will focus on exploring the relationship between various factors and tipping behavior. This might involve:
- Visualizing distributions of trip fares, distances, and durations.
- Identifying patterns in tipping based on these factors.
- Analyzing the influence of payment method on tipping (cash vs. cashless).
- Examining the impact of other relevant features (if available).


## Prediction Model:
A machine learning model will be developed to predict the likelihood of a tip being received for a ride. This model will be trained on the historical ride-hailing data. The specific model type will be chosen based on the data characteristics and project goals.

## Potential Applications: The insights from this project can be valuable for ride-hailing companies to:
- Understand customer tipping behavior.
- Develop strategies to encourage tipping (if applicable).
- Improve their pricing models.

## Project Structure: The project code and notebooks will be organized to facilitate understanding and maintainability.


Additional Notes: The idea of the project came from a course in Machine Learning from the University of Cologne in Germany. However, all the data used in the workbooks was collected, reorganized and preprocessed on my own. The idea, however, greatly adheres to what the assignment from said course instructed.

Finally, this README only provides a general overview. Specific details about the data, analysis methods, and model chosen will be documented within the project code.
Feel free to modify this file to include more specific details about your project and data.
